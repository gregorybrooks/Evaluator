preparing to test a new ballistic missile, in what could be an early challenge for Trump\u2019s administration.\nNorth Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and its main ally, the United States, conducted two nuclear tests in 2016 and more than 20 missile tests, in defiance of UN resolutions and sanctions.\nIn his New Year\u2019s speech the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Pyongyang was in the  final stages  of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Trump responded with a tweet that said  It won\u2019t happen!  but has not explained how he would prevent a North Korean ICBM test launch.\nThe North appears to have also restarted operation of a reactor at its main Yongbyon nuclear facility that produces plutonium suitable for its nuclear weapons programme, according to US thinktank 38 North.\nMattis said:  North Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons programme and engage in threatening rhetoric and behaviour. \nNorth Korea\u2019s actions have prompted the US and South Korea to respond by bolstering defences, including the deployment of a US missile defence system, known as terminal high-altitude area defence (Thaad) in South Korea later this year.\nMattis and his South Korean counterpart, Han Min-koo, on Friday agreed to deploy Thaad  as a defence system solely against North Korea\u2019s missile threat , the South Korean defence ministry said in a statement\nChina has objected to Thaad, saying it will destabilise the regional security balance, and some South Korean opposition leaders have called for it to be delayed or cancelled.\nHan said the agreement on Thaad indicated that South Korea would continue to enjoy strong US support under Trump.  Faced with a current severe security situation, secretary Mattis\u2019s visit to Korea \u2026 also communicates the strongest warning to North Korea,  he said.\nOnce fully developed a North Korean ICBM could threaten the United States, which is about 9,000km away (5,500 miles). ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500km (3,400 miles) but some can travel 10,000km (6,200 miles) or more.\nFormer US officials and other experts have said the United States essentially has two options when it comes to trying to curb North Korea\u2019s fast-expanding nuclear and missile programmes: negotiate or take military action.\nSome analysts say China\u2019s opposition to Thaad makes it less likely that Beijing will act to rein in North Korea \u2013 a demand made by Trump and Barack Obama.\n Deepening tensions between China and the US adds to the North\u2019s strategic value in the eyes of China,  said Lee Ji-yong, a professor at the Institute for Foreign Affairs and Security.  It will make it more difficult for the US to persuade China to cooperate in pressuring the North to give up its nuclear arsenal.

States\nMore\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared Saturday that Pyongyang would halt nuclear tests and intercontinental missile launches, five months after its last ICBM launch amid a rapid diplomatic thaw.\nHere are the key steps in the development of the regime's banned nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes:\n- The beginnings, 1970s -\nNorth Korea starts working in the late 1970s on a version of the Soviet Scud-B missile with a range of around 300 kilometres (around 200 miles), carrying out a first test in 1984.\nBetween 1987 and 1992, it begins developing longer-range

ties with the United States improve.\n- First nuclear test in 2006 -\nIt ends the moratorium in 2005, blaming the Bush administration's  hostile  policy, and carries out its first nuclear test on October 9, 2006.\nIn May 2009, there is a second underground nuclear test, several times more powerful than the first. Kim Jong Un succeeds his father Kim Jong Il -- who dies in December 2011 -- and oversees a third nuclear test in 2013.\n- 2016, Japanese waters reached -\nThere is a fourth underground nuclear test in January 2016, which Pyongyang claims is a hydrogen bomb.\nIn March, Kim Jong Un claims the North has successfully miniaturised a thermonuclear warhead, and in April it test-fires a submarine-launched ballistic missile.\nOn August 3, it fires, for the first time, a ballistic missile directly into Japanese-controlled waters. Later that month, it successfully test-fires another submarine\u2013launched ballistic missile.\nThere is a fifth nuclear test on September 9.\n- 2017, Japan and Guam under threat -\nBetween February and May, the North tests a series of ballistic missiles that fall into the Sea of Japan. Pyongyang claims these are exercises to hit US bases in Japan.\nA test on May 14 is of a  newly developed mid\/long-range strategic ballistic rocket, Hwasong-12 , Pyongyang says. It flies 700 kilometres before landing in the Sea of Japan.\nTwo months later, North Korea announces it successfully tested on July 4 -- the US independence day -- an ICBM capable of reaching Alaska, a gift for the  American bastards . There is a second successful ICBM test on July 28.\nHours after US President Donald Trump threatens Pyongyang on August 8 with  fire and fury  over its missile programme, the North says it is considering strikes near US strategic military installations in Guam.\n- Largest nuclear test yet -\nOn September 3, North Korea conducts its sixth and largest nuclear test.

The September 2016 test, according to North Korean state media, involved a standardized and compact nuclear device, one that could be mounted on any of its various short, medium, intermediate, and intercontinental-range missiles (ICBMs).\nThe expected yield - or explosive power - of those weapons might be of the order of two-to-three times the weapon that the United States used against Nagasaki in the final days of the Second World War -  but that's quite powerful enough for North Korea's purposes.\nMore seriously, North Korea's most recent nuclear test demonstrated that it had the capability to generate seriously powerful nuclear yields.\nWhile independent experts and various national intelligence agencies haven't reached a consensus on whether North Korea had truly mastered a thermonuclear bomb design, as it claimed to have done, the seismic data recorded on 3 September 2017 gave the world enough information to conclude that North Korea had a nuclear device capable of \"city-busting\" explosive yields.\nThe bottom line is that just as Kim Jong-un's recent trip to Beijing was a show of strength - a signal that he felt comfortable enough in his consolidated domestic power to leave North Korea - so too is the declaration of a nuclear test ban a sign that he feels renewed confidence.\nLimited costs to halting missile tests\nRegarding his missiles, Kim has said that he will no longer test ICBMs.\nOn the one hand, that's surprising.\nNorth Korea has conducted just three tests in total of missiles that could deliver nuclear weapons to the contiguous United States. None of these tests have involved a missile flying on a trajectory similar to what might be necessary for a nuclear strike, leaving further flight-testing something of a necessity for North Korea to become sufficiently confident in its ability to strike the US homeland.\nBut North Korea may have other plans. For instance, while it has mastered most of what is necessary on a technical level to threaten the United States, its missile forces continue to be limited by a small number of launchers. Currently, North Korea has probably only six launch vehicles for its ICBMs.\nEven though Kim Jong-un, during his 2017 New Year's address, declared his nuclear forces \"complete,\" there is good reason to believe that he would want to increase his ICBM launchers and even work on components of North Korea's nuclear command and control systems.\nTactically, then, submitting to a self-imposed ICBM flight-testing ban would have limited costs.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE >\nKim Jong-un has taken a close personal interest in the North Korean missile programme\n© KCNA via REUTERS\nEasy to break ban\nUltimately, these test bans are restricted in their extent.\nThe nuclear test ban could be made credible by a bona fide gesture at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. North Korea, for instance, could demolish its test tunnels; the statement released on Saturday notes only  that the site will be \"dismantled\".\nBut as long as North Korea hangs on to its missiles, it can break its self-imposed ban with little warning. In 1999, North Korea submitted to a missile testing moratorium, but that eventually broke down in 2006, a few years after the collapse of the 1994 Agreed Framework.\nBeyond the bans, Mr Kim used the latest Central Committee meeting to tout the success of his fundamental national strategic project, which is summarized in what he has called the byungjin line. This concept refers to the simultaneous development of a powerful state nuclear force alongside a more prosperous economy.\nOn Saturday, Kim Jng-un clearly indicated that with the cessation of nuclear testing, he will \"concentrate all the efforts on building a powerful socialist economy and markedly improving the standard of people's living.\"\nThat should be taken seriously. North Korea will seek relief from international sanctions at the forthcoming summits to realise this objective.\nThe summit is the prize\nThe concessions from North Korea have come before the two anticipated summits with the United States and South Korea.\nOne may wonder why Mr Kim should give up so much in advance instead of hanging on to a nuclear test-ban and an ICBM moratorium as aces up his sleeve to give up when he meets US President Donald Trump.\nThe answer is simple:  a summit with a US president is enough of a prize in itself. For Mr Kim, it's something that neither his grandfather nor his father could attain.\nIn the end, what North Korea loses by demolishing its nuclear test site and submitting to a unilateral moratorium on ICBM launches is entirely tolerable compared to what Mr Kim gains by sitting alongside President Trump.\nReading KCNA's announcements on Saturday, there is also absolutely no hint of the \"denuclearization\" intent that South Korean officials have been eager to tout on North Korea's behalf.\nOn the contrary, North Korea's announcement sounds like the declamations of a nuclear weapons state - one that has no intention of giving up those weapons which give the country its ultimate guarantee of survival.\nEven though President Trump has lauded Mr Kim's move as \"big progress,\" the sooner he recognises Kim's ultimate objectives, the better.\nAnkit Panda is an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists and a senior editor at The

be effective and overwhelming,\u201D Mattis said in Seoul before leaving for Japan, where he will meet the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and the country\u2019s foreign and defence ministers.\n'Let it be an arms race': Donald Trump appears to double down on nuclear expansion\nRead more\nAbe, who claimed to have established a rapport with Trump during their first meeting in New York last November, will be buoyed by reports that Mattis does not intend to broach the subject of host-nation payments towards supporting almost 50,000 US troops based in Japan.\nThe US also has 28,500 troops in South Korea, mostly ranged along the heavily armed border separating it from the North.\nJapan has said that it pays its fair share towards maintaining a US troops presence, mainly on the southern island of Okinawa.\nAbe, who is to meet Trump in Washington next week, told MPs he would remind Mattis about \u201Cthe significance of the Japan-US alliance\u201D.\nMattis\u2019s remarks in Seoul come amid concern that North Korea could be preparing to test a new ballistic missile, in what could be an early challenge for Trump\u2019s administration.\nNorth Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and its main ally, the United States, conducted two nuclear tests in 2016 and more than 20 missile tests, in defiance of UN resolutions and sanctions.\nIn his New Year\u2019s speech the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Pyongyang was in the \u201Cfinal stages\u201D of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Trump responded with a tweet that said \u201CIt won\u2019t happen!\u201D but has not explained how he would prevent a North Korean ICBM test launch.\nThe North appears to have also restarted operation of a reactor at its main Yongbyon nuclear facility that produces plutonium suitable for its nuclear weapons programme, according to US thinktank 38 North.\nMattis said: \u201CNorth Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons programme and engage in threatening rhetoric and behaviour.\u201D\nNorth Korea\u2019s actions have prompted the US and South Korea to respond by bolstering defences, including the deployment of a US missile defence system, known as terminal high-altitude area defence (Thaad) in South Korea later this year.\nMattis and his South Korean counterpart, Han Min-koo, on Friday agreed to deploy Thaad \u201Cas a defence system solely against North Korea\u2019s missile threat\u201D, the South Korean defence ministry said in a statement\nChina has objected to Thaad, saying it will destabilise the regional security balance, and some South Korean opposition leaders have called for it to be delayed or cancelled.\nHan said the agreement on Thaad indicated that South Korea would continue to enjoy strong US support under Trump. \u201CFaced with a current severe security situation, secretary Mattis\u2019s visit to Korea \u2026 also communicates the strongest warning to North Korea,\u201D he said.\nOnce fully developed a North Korean ICBM could threaten the United States, which is about 9,000km away (5,500 miles). ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500km (3,400 miles) but some can travel 10,000km (6,200 miles) or more.\nFormer US officials and other experts have said the United States essentially has two options when it comes to trying to curb North Korea\u2019s fast-expanding nuclear and missile programmes: negotiate or take military action.\nSome analysts say China\u2019s opposition to Thaad makes it less likely that Beijing will act to rein in North Korea \u2013 a demand made by Trump and Barack Obama.\n\u201CDeepening tensions between China and the US adds to the North\u2019s strategic value in the eyes of China,\u201D said Lee Ji-yong, a professor at the Institute for Foreign Affairs and Security. \u201CIt will make it more difficult for the US to persuade China to cooperate in pressuring the North to give up its nuclear arsenal.\u201D\nTopics","doc-id":"586e2078-5b5b-4788-906e-27557b85e828","isi-events":[{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":2427,"string":"tests","hstring":"tests","start":2422,"hstart":2422,"end":2427},"patients":[{"synclass":"name","hend":2322,"string":"South

North Korea will seek relief from international sanctions at the forthcoming summits to realise this objective.\nThe summit is the prize\nThe concessions from North Korea have come before the two anticipated summits with the United States and South Korea.\nOne may wonder why Mr Kim should give up so much in advance instead of hanging on to a nuclear test-ban and an ICBM moratorium as aces up his sleeve to give up when he meets US President Donald Trump.\nThe answer is simple:  a summit with a US president is enough of a prize in itself. For Mr Kim, it's something that neither his grandfather nor his father could attain.\nIn the end, what North Korea loses by demolishing its nuclear test site and submitting to a unilateral moratorium on ICBM launches is entirely tolerable compared to what Mr Kim gains by sitting alongside President Trump.\nReading KCNA's announcements on Saturday, there is also absolutely no hint of the \"denuclearization\" intent that South Korean officials have been eager to tout on North Korea's behalf.\nOn the contrary, North Korea's announcement sounds like the declamations of a nuclear weapons state - one that has no intention of giving up those weapons which give the country its ultimate guarantee of survival.\nEven though President Trump has lauded Mr Kim's move as \"big progress,\" the sooner he recognises Kim's ultimate objectives, the better.\nAnkit Panda is an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists and a senior editor at The

States\nMore\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared Saturday that Pyongyang would halt nuclear tests and intercontinental missile launches, five months after its last ICBM launch amid a rapid diplomatic thaw.\nHere are the key steps in the development of the regime's banned nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes:\n- The beginnings, 1970s -\nNorth Korea starts working in the late 1970s on a version of the Soviet Scud-B missile with a range of around 300 kilometres (around 200 miles), carrying out a first test in 1984.\nBetween 1987 and 1992, it begins developing longer-range missiles, including the Taepodong-1 (2,500 km) and Taepodong-2 (6,700 km).\nThe Taepodong-1 is test-fired over Japan in 1998 but the following year, Pyongyang declares a moratorium on such tests as ties with the United States improve.\n- First nuclear test in 2006 -\nIt ends the moratorium in 2005, blaming the Bush administration's \"hostile\" policy, and carries out its first nuclear test on October 9, 2006.\nIn May 2009, there is a second underground nuclear test, several times more powerful than the first. Kim Jong Un succeeds his father Kim Jong Il -- who dies in December 2011 -- and oversees a third nuclear test in 2013.\n- 2016, Japanese waters reached -\nThere is a fourth underground nuclear test in January 2016, which Pyongyang claims is a hydrogen bomb.\nIn March, Kim Jong Un claims the North has successfully miniaturised a thermonuclear warhead, and in April it test-fires a submarine-launched ballistic missile.\nOn August 3, it fires, for the first time, a ballistic missile directly into Japanese-controlled waters. Later that month, it successfully test-fires another submarine\u2013launched ballistic missile.\nThere is a fifth nuclear test on September 9.\n- 2017, Japan and Guam under threat -\nBetween February and May, the North tests a series of ballistic missiles that fall into the Sea of Japan. Pyongyang claims these are exercises to hit US bases in Japan.\nA test on May 14 is of a \"newly developed mid\/long-range strategic ballistic rocket, Hwasong-12\", Pyongyang says. It flies 700 kilometres before landing in the Sea of Japan.\nTwo months later, North Korea announces it successfully tested on July 4 -- the US independence day -- an ICBM capable of reaching Alaska, a gift for the \"American bastards\". There is a second successful ICBM test on July 28.\nHours after US President Donald Trump threatens Pyongyang on August 8 with \"fire and fury\" over its missile programme, the North says it is considering strikes near US strategic military installations in Guam.\n- Largest nuclear test yet -\nOn September 3, North Korea conducts its sixth and largest nuclear test. Monitoring groups estimate a yield of 250 kilotons, which is 16 times the size of the 15-kiloton US bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.\nOn September 15, less than a week after the UN adopts an eighth series of sanctions, North Korea fires an intermediate-range missile over Japan.\nOn November 20, Washington declares North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism, a day before adding to pressure on the isolated state with fresh sanctions.\nOn November 29, North Korea launches a new Hwasong-15 ICBM, which it claims could deliver a \"super-large heavy warhead\" anywhere on the US

the development of North Korea's nuclear force had been completed.\nCatalysed by the Winter Olympics in the South, a rapid diplomatic thaw begins in February.\nOn April 21, Pyongyang declares that nuclear blasts and ICBM launches will cease immediately and the atomic test site at Punggye-ri will be dismantled to \"transparently guarantee\" the end of testing.\nKim adds that the possession of

He was looking for unambiguous signs of success: pairs of fireballs (at night) or smoke clouds (during the day) that formed as speeding fragments blew up a warhead. He found very few, he said.\nHis method of video analysis won scientific backing long ago. During the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the American military boasted that Patriot interceptors, built in the United States, had succeeded 96 percent of the time. But M.I.T. scientists analyzed broadcast videos and found only misses. Slowly, the Army retreated.\nMr. Lloyd also has the credentials for a critique, having written two books on antimissile warhead design during two decades at Raytheon, a top antimissile contractor. He now works for Tesla Laboratories, a defense contractor that has no projects competing with Iron Dome.\nMr. Lloyd says his doubts about Iron Dome deepened as he saw images of interceptors racing helter-skelter in the sky and found photographs of fallen rockets and even intact warheads.\nFrom such evidence, as well as from rocket and warhead basics, Mr. Lloyd estimates that the system succeeded 30 percent to 40 percent of the time in detonating enemy warheads. For the remaining targets, he judges that the interceptor was either badly aligned or too far away, at best leaving the rockets wounded or thrown off course.\nMr. Lloyd and other critics acknowledge that, in some cases, deflections may indeed lessen damage on the ground, though they lack specific information.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nIn Israel, Mr. Lloyd won support from Reuven Pedatzur, a military analyst and former fighter pilot long skeptical of his country\u2019s antimissile claims. Dr. Pedatzur found an Israeli police report saying that 109 rockets launched from Gaza \u2014 roughly twice the military\u2019s figure \u2014 hit urban areas.\nHe also found evidence of wide destruction. A Finance Ministry report registered 3,165 claims of property damage, including to cars and buildings in cities like Ashdod and Beersheba, both protected by Iron Dome battalions.\nTheodore A. Postol, a physicist at M.I.T. who helped reveal the Patriot antimissile failures of 1991, analyzed the new videos and found that Iron Dome repeatedly failed to hit its targets head-on. He concluded that the many dives, loops and curls of the interceptors resulted in diverse angles of attack that made it nearly impossible to destroy enemy warheads.\n It\u2019s very hard to see how it could be more than 5 or 10 percent,  Dr. Postol said.\nMordechai Shefer, an Israeli rocket scientist formerly with Rafael, Iron Dome\u2019s maker, studied nearly two dozen videos and, in a paper last month, concluded that the kill rate was zero.\nAmerican supporters of Iron Dome see the declarations of Israeli officials as credible, in part because the weapon\u2019s targets are relatively slow, small and unsophisticated.  They have no guidance system,  noted Riki Ellison, chairman of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance , a private group in Alexandria, Va.  They\u2019re not as accurate as missiles, so Israel doesn\u2019t have to hit them all. \nThe senior Israeli official who defended Iron Dome said he understood the skepticism because the world\u2019s first antimissile war \u2014 which erupted over Israel in 1991 during the gulf war \u2014 did produce exaggerated claims of success. But he rejected the idea that Iron Dome was missing or deflecting most of its targets. The images of online videos, he suggested, lacked the sharpness to reliably see kills within the glowing fireballs.\nEnemy warheads, the official stressed, were  destroyed \u2014 not engaged \u2014 destroyed.  But as the interview unfolded, he offered examples of partial rocket destruction that seemed to contradict the portrayals of total annihilation. Falling debris, he conceded, could sometimes destroy a car or damage a house. But he dismissed reports of wide damage on the ground as rumors.\nThe Obama administration has cited the videos as testimonials to the system\u2019s importance.  Everybody gets it,  Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recently told the annual meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, prompting thousands to break into applause.

He was looking for unambiguous signs of success: pairs of fireballs (at night) or smoke clouds (during the day) that formed as speeding fragments blew up a warhead. He found very few, he said.\nHis method of video analysis won scientific backing long ago. During the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the American military boasted that Patriot interceptors, built in the United States, had succeeded 96 percent of the time. But M.I.T. scientists analyzed broadcast videos and found only misses. Slowly, the Army retreated.\nMr. Lloyd also has the credentials for a critique, having written two books on antimissile warhead design during two decades at Raytheon, a top antimissile contractor. He now works for Tesla Laboratories, a defense contractor that has no projects competing with Iron Dome.\nMr. Lloyd says his doubts about Iron Dome deepened as he saw images of interceptors racing helter-skelter in the sky and found photographs of fallen rockets and even intact warheads.\nFrom such evidence, as well as from rocket and warhead basics, Mr. Lloyd estimates that the system succeeded 30 percent to 40 percent of the time in detonating enemy warheads. For the remaining targets, he judges that the interceptor was either badly aligned or too far away, at best leaving the rockets wounded or thrown off course.\nMr. Lloyd and other critics acknowledge that, in some cases, deflections may indeed lessen damage on the ground, though they lack specific information.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nIn Israel, Mr. Lloyd won support from Reuven Pedatzur, a military analyst and former fighter pilot long skeptical of his country\u2019s antimissile claims. Dr. Pedatzur found an Israeli police report saying that 109 rockets launched from Gaza \u2014 roughly twice the military\u2019s figure \u2014 hit urban areas.\nHe also found evidence of wide destruction. A Finance Ministry report registered 3,165 claims of property damage, including to cars and buildings in cities like Ashdod and Beersheba, both protected by Iron Dome battalions.\nTheodore A. Postol, a physicist at M.I.T. who helped reveal the Patriot antimissile failures of 1991, analyzed the new videos and found that Iron Dome repeatedly failed to hit its targets head-on. He concluded that the many dives, loops and curls of the interceptors resulted in diverse angles of attack that made it nearly impossible to destroy enemy warheads.\n\u201CIt\u2019s very hard to see how it could be more than 5 or 10 percent,\u201D Dr. Postol said.\nMordechai Shefer, an Israeli rocket scientist formerly with Rafael, Iron Dome\u2019s maker, studied nearly two dozen videos and, in a paper last month, concluded that the kill rate was zero.\nAmerican supporters of Iron Dome see the declarations of Israeli officials as credible, in part because the weapon\u2019s targets are relatively slow, small and unsophisticated. \u201CThey have no guidance system,\u201D noted Riki Ellison, chairman of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance , a private group in Alexandria, Va. \u201CThey\u2019re not as accurate as missiles, so Israel doesn\u2019t have to hit them all.\u201D\nThe senior Israeli official who defended Iron Dome said he understood the skepticism because the world\u2019s first antimissile war \u2014 which erupted over Israel in 1991 during the gulf war \u2014 did produce exaggerated claims of success. But he rejected the idea that Iron Dome was missing or deflecting most of its targets. The images of online videos, he suggested, lacked the sharpness to reliably see kills within the glowing fireballs.\nEnemy warheads, the official stressed, were \u201Cdestroyed \u2014 not engaged \u2014 destroyed.\u201D But as the interview unfolded, he offered examples of partial rocket destruction that seemed to contradict the portrayals of total annihilation. Falling debris, he conceded, could sometimes destroy a car or damage a house. But he dismissed reports of wide damage on the ground as rumors.\nThe Obama administration has cited the videos as testimonials to the system\u2019s importance. \u201CEverybody gets it,\u201D Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recently told the annual meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, prompting thousands to break into applause. \u201CEverybody saw.\u201D\nDavid E.

Chinese President Hu Jintao's African trips have included pocket-sized Gabon, whose 1.4 million people could fit into a corner of Shanghai but which has more than two billion barrels of oil reserves.

(Full story)\n We haven't been totally invaded by China yet, but it will come,  says Iheanyi Ohiaeri, head of business development for Nigeria's National Petroleum Corp.  I get calls and e-mails daily from Beijing, from people looking to buy oil. \nThe calls are being answered, in part because African governments view China as a more cooperative partner than the West. China has refused to back regular Western rebukes of African corruption and human-rights abuses and last year used its permanent seat on the UN Security Council to block genocide charges against Sudan -- source of about 7 percent of China's oil -- for the massacres in Darfur.\n The U.S. will talk to you about governance, about efficiency, about security, about the environment,  says Mustafa Bello, head of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission, who has visited China seven times.  The Chinese just ask, 'How do we procure this license?' \nChina has become the biggest foreign investor in Zimbabwe, where President Robert Mugabe's policies have beggared the country and left millions homeless. Zimbabwe doesn't have oil, but it is the world's second-largest exporter of platinum, a key import for China's auto industry.\nChinese radio-jamming devices block Zimbabwe's dissident broadcasts, and Chinese workers built Mugabe's new $9 million home, featuring a blue-tiled roof donated by the Chinese government. While Western politicians railed against Mugabe last year for flattening entire shantytowns, China was supplying him with fighter jets and troop carriers worth about $240 million, in exchange for imports of gold and tobacco.\nChina has also agreed to sell armaments to Nigeria -- $251 million worth of Chinese fighter jets, financed by China's Exim Bank -- and satellite technology provided by defense contractor Norinco.  If China wanted to go out and develop Europe, it would be impossible,  says Dai Adi, a Chinese journalist in Lagos who moved from Beijing in 2001.  But here they can. \nThe next hot spot may be Angola, where offshore oil could transform the country from one of Africa's poorest to one of its richest. In late 2004, while International Monetary Fund officials were berating Angola for corrupt oil dealings, China gave the government $2 billion in credit to repair railway tracks bombed in the country's long civil war and to construct new office buildings in the capital -- all using Chinese contractors. The timing was flawless: When French oil company Total applied to renew its license on a large oil-production block, Angola refused, handing it instead to Sinopec, with which it then formed a joint venture to bid on other oilfields.\nChina, however, faces its own challenges in Africa. Tony Chukweke, head of Nigeria's Department of Petroleum Resources, admits that he often finds it difficult to negotiate with Chinese companies, since each detail requires approval from officials in Beijing.  It is very, very slow,  he says.  They go back and forth. And when they come back, sometimes you find it is not what you agreed to.  Chukweke, who worked for years as a Shell geophysicist in London, prefers negotiating with Western oil companies:  Exxon comes in with clear mandates,  he says.  We can negotiate within those mandates. \nStill, China's intense energy needs make it an alluring partner. Nigeria's oil-business development manager Ohiaeri points out that his government can pressure China far more than it can Western governments.  They are desperate for our resources,  he notes. That symbiotic relationship continues to grow, and with each passing day -- and each new deal -- China's role in the region

11:41 AM ET\nFalling oil prices hit Nigeria's economy\nAnother day, another oil producer in trouble.\nNigeria is considering asking the World Bank, the African Development Bank and other international organizations for help to plug a hole in this year's budget created by the collapse in crude oil prices. The government said it is looking to borrow as much as $9 billion to fund its cash-starved economy.\nThe 75% plunge in crude prices to around $33 per barrel means Nigeria is now losing money on some of the oil it pumps.\nNigeria is the second major oil producing country, after Azerbaijan , to admit it might need emergency financing because of low crude prices.\nNigeria, Africa's largest economy, is also the continent's biggest oil producer. The sector accounts for about 35% of GDP, 75% of government revenue and 90% of export earnings.\nIts currency is plummeting, with foreign exchange dealers offering much higher rates than the official 199 nair per dollar. The government has been burning through its foreign currency reserves, which fell to $28 billion at the end of January from $43 billion two years ago.\nAnd its budget deficit is growing fast. The government wants to invest in big infrastructure projects and make the country less dependent on oil.\nThe deficit is now expected to reach 3 trillion naira ($15 billion) in 2016, up from a previous estimate of 2.2 trillion.\nNigeria is also suffering from frequent power cuts and fuel shortages because it doesn't have enough capacity to refine it own crude.\nRelated: 5 countries crushed by oil price collapse\nThe finance ministry denied reports that it has already asked for emergency cash, but said it is considering a World Bank loan as one way of funding the deficit.\n The truth is that Nigeria... has indicated an intention to borrow 1.8 trillion naira principally for investment in capital projects to stimulate the economy,  Finance Minister Kemi Adeosun said in a statement.\nNigeria is exploring the option of borrowing from multilateral organizations such as the World Bank and AFDB, as well as the Export-Import Bank of China, because they offer lower rates of interest than other lenders, she said.\nOfficials from the African Development Bank visited Nigeria last week.\nNigeria is a member of OPEC , and has been pushing for the Saudi-led oil cartel to cut production to support prices.\nOPEC decided in 2014 to wage a price war with low cost producers in the U.S. and elsewhere in a bid to defend market share.

partner than the West.\nBy Vivienne Walt , FORTUNE\nFebruary 15, 2006:  5:53 AM EST\nNEW YORK (FORTUNE) - China, the world's second-largest energy consumer, now imports about 28 percent of its oil and gas from sub-Saharan Africa, compared with about 15 percent for the U.S.\nIn the past few years, China's leading energy companies -- Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp., and CNOOC -- have inked oil contracts from Equatorial Guinea to Algeria to Angola. Chinese President Hu Jintao's African trips have included pocket-sized Gabon, whose 1.4 million people could fit into a corner of Shanghai but which has more than two billion barrels of oil reserves. When China's Foreign Minister, Li Zhaoxing, toured the region in January, he spent several days in Nigeria.\nSee more photos\nChina's African Safari\nIn the heated race to tap a continent's oil resources, China is making headway in countries like Nigeria, where others often fear to tread. (Full story)\n\"We haven't been totally invaded by China yet, but it will come,\" says Iheanyi Ohiaeri, head of business development for Nigeria's National Petroleum Corp. \"I get calls and e-mails daily from Beijing, from people looking to buy oil.\"\nThe calls are being answered, in part because African governments view China as a more cooperative partner than the West. China has refused to back regular Western rebukes of African corruption and human-rights abuses and last year used its permanent seat on the UN Security Council to block genocide charges against Sudan -- source of about 7 percent of China's oil -- for the massacres in Darfur.\n\"The U.S. will talk to you about governance, about efficiency, about security, about the environment,\" says Mustafa Bello, head of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission, who has visited China seven times. \"The Chinese just ask, 'How do we procure this license?'\"\nChina has become the biggest foreign investor in Zimbabwe, where President Robert Mugabe's policies have beggared the country and left millions homeless. Zimbabwe doesn't have oil, but it is the world's second-largest exporter of platinum, a key import for China's auto industry.\nChinese radio-jamming devices block Zimbabwe's dissident broadcasts, and Chinese workers built Mugabe's new $9 million home, featuring a blue-tiled roof donated by the Chinese government. While Western politicians railed against Mugabe last year for flattening entire shantytowns, China was supplying him with fighter jets and troop carriers worth about $240 million, in exchange for imports of gold and tobacco.\nChina has also agreed to sell armaments to Nigeria -- $251 million worth of Chinese fighter jets, financed by China's Exim Bank -- and satellite technology provided by defense contractor Norinco. \"If China wanted to go out and develop Europe, it would be impossible,\" says Dai Adi, a Chinese journalist in Lagos who moved from Beijing in 2001. \"But here they can.\"\nThe next hot spot may be Angola, where offshore oil could transform the country from one of Africa's poorest to one of its richest. In late 2004, while International Monetary Fund officials were berating Angola for corrupt oil dealings, China gave the government $2 billion in credit to repair railway tracks bombed in the country's long civil war and to construct new office buildings in the capital -- all using Chinese contractors. The timing was flawless: When French oil company Total applied to renew its license on a large oil-production block, Angola refused, handing it instead to Sinopec, with which it then formed a joint venture to bid on other oilfields.\nChina, however, faces its own challenges in Africa. Tony Chukweke, head of Nigeria's Department of Petroleum Resources, admits that he often finds it difficult to negotiate with Chinese companies, since each detail requires approval from officials in Beijing. \"It is very, very slow,\" he says. \"They go back and forth. And when they come back, sometimes you find it is not what you agreed to.\" Chukweke, who worked for years as a Shell geophysicist in London, prefers negotiating with Western oil companies: \"Exxon comes in with clear mandates,\" he says. \"We can negotiate within those mandates.\"\nStill, China's intense energy needs make it an alluring partner. Nigeria's oil-business development manager Ohiaeri points out that his government can pressure China far more than it can Western governments. \"They are desperate for our resources,\" he notes. That symbiotic relationship continues to grow, and with each passing day -- and each new deal -- China's role in the region deepens.","doc-id":"29d6e2a1-6ccc-47d8-b7aa-80b71b5ae827","isi-events":[{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":2101,"string":"homeless","hstring":"homeless","start":2093,"hstart":2093,"end":2101},"patients":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":2092,"string":"millions","hstring":"millions","start":2084,"hstart":2084,"end":2092}],"sentenceID":23,"eventType":"Economic-Event-or-SoA","agents":[]},{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":1912,"string":"ask","hstring":"ask","start":1909,"hstart":1909,"end":1912},"patients":[],"sentenceID":22,"eventType":"Communicate-Event","agents":[{"synclass":"name","hend":1903,"string":"The

against EPA alleges negligence in Flint, Michigan, water crisis\nThe EPA is reviewing the complaint, spokesman says, declining further comment\n(CNN)\nAn administrative complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency alleges negligence and demands more than $220 million in damages for its role in the Flint, Michigan, water crisis.\nThe discovery of high levels of lead in Flint's tap water has unleashed a floodgate of lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved residents in the two years since officials switched the city water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River to save money. The highly polluted river corroded old pipes and leached lead into tap water, according to experts.\nFiled on the second anniversary of the water switch, Monday's notice of class action administrative complaint was brought on behalf of hundreds of residents under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\nThe EPA is reviewing the complaint, agency spokesman Dan Abrams said, declining further comment.\nThe complaint was filed on behalf Jan Burgess and 513 other current and former Flint residents who were exposed to  toxic and highly corrosive  water for 539 days, beginning on April 25, 2014, according to the complaint. An additional filing on behalf of another 250 Flint water users is to be made next week.\nRead More\nAfter making numerous complaints to state and city officials about poor water quality, Burgess in mid-October 2014 asked the federal EPA to investigate her concerns.\nLess than a week later, EPA representative Jennifer Crooks informed Burgess that the poor water quality was  only a temporary problem  and that state and city officials were working on it, the complaint said.

Her firing followed the resignations in December of the department\u2019s director, Dan Wyant, and chief spokesman, Brad Wurfel, both of whom were criticized for failing to recognize the scope of Flint\u2019s water problems and for belittling those who attempted to raise alarms. A fourth employee, who worked under Ms. Shekter Smith, has been suspended.\n Putting the well-being of Michiganders first needs to be the top priority for all state employees,  Gov. Rick Snyder said in a statement about the firing.  Anything less than that is unacceptable. The D.E.Q. is working to change this culture and ensure mistakes that endanger our residents don\u2019t occur again. \nThough a number of government agencies have been faulted for their response in Flint, the Environmental Quality Department has been held up by critics as particularly egregious. That agency failed to require corrosion controls mandated under federal law when Flint changed its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in April 2014. The lack of anti-corrosion chemicals caused pipes to disintegrate and leach lead into the water. Lead, which is especially harmful to children, is toxic and can have irreversible health effects. After initially dismissing outsiders who warned of the lead risk, Environmental Quality officials admitted in October that they had erred in not requiring corrosion controls.\nIn recent weeks, Michigan\u2019s attorney general, the F.B.I. and other federal agencies have announced investigations. Mr. Snyder, who has apologized to Flint residents, has been under fire. Hillary Clinton has announced plans to visit Flint on Sunday, and she and Bernie Sanders will hold a debate there next month.\nOn Friday, Mr. Sanders, responding to the release of emails that showed state and local officials had also delayed warning residents about an outbreak of Legionnaire\u2019s disease that they suspected could be related to the water supply, again called for the resignation of Mr. Snyder, a Republican.\nA Republican-led Congressional committee has also targeted the United States Environmental Protection Agency for scrutiny. At a hearing on Wednesday, committee members pressed the agency for an explanation of why top officials waited months to publicize their own scientist\u2019s concerns about lead in Flint. Susan Hedman, a presidential appointee who oversaw the E.P.A. regional office in charge of Michigan, announced her resignation last month.\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Michigan Water Regulator Fired for Role in Flint Crisis as Fallout Continues.

The goal of his trip, the White House says, is to highlight a resurgent American auto industry.\nRead More\nFlint, the birthplace of General Motors that once employed 80,000 autoworkers, but which now faces widespread poverty after auto jobs largely left the city, has been reeling from the discovery that its water contains dangerously high levels of lead.\nThe revelation has led to accusations of government negligence and political cover-ups. Focus has honed in on Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, who opponents claim took too long to respond when tests indicated high levels of lead in Flint's drinking water.\nThe EPA on Tuesday accused Michigan state officials of  failures and resistance  in working with the federal government  in a forthright, transparent and proactive manner consistent with the seriousness of the risks to public health. \n We must ensure this situation never happens again,  the EPA's statement read, adding  we also must look at what the agency could have done differently. \nSpeaking Tuesday on a conference call organized by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Weaver said she came to Washington hoping to secure more federal support for her city.\n We still need some federal assistance because they money from the state is not going to be enough to rectify the situation here that we have in Flint,  Weaver said.  It's ongoing. It's going to be following some of these people for the rest of their lives. \nThe White House said Tuesday it was tasking Nicole Lurie, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health Human Services, with coordinating federal response to the Flint crisis. She was scheduled to travel to Flint on Wednesday.\nOver the weekend, Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint, which allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide the city with bottled water and filters worth up to $5 million.\nThat's far less than what the city says it needs to deal with the water contamination crisis, and Snyder has requested Obama declare the situation in Flint a disaster. The White House has resisted the appeal, insisting such a designation is only permitted after natural occurrences like hurricanes and blizzards.\nClinton, meanwhile, has attempted to use the Flint crisis as a demonstration of her leadership skills while she confronts a closer-than-expected Democratic primary race against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nRaising the issue unprompted during Sunday evening's Democratic presidential debate, Clinton took responsibility for spurring action in the state's leadership.\n I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a TV show and I said it was outrageous that the governor hadn't acted and within two hours he had,  Clinton said.  I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.

Flint residents have been outraged that high-ranking officials have so far escaped any consequences.\nBut the Michigan attorney general, Bill Schuette, hinted at a news conference on Friday that charges against higher-level officials might follow, saying that investigators were  moving up the chain  and  going where the truth takes us, period. \nThe widening inquiry comes as Flint\u2019s residents continue to cope with the effects of the contamination. Concerns about the water emerged more than two years ago, but residents\u2019 complaints were brushed off until last fall, when Gov. Rick Snyder acknowledged the scope of the problem.\nTests continue to show that unfiltered tap water is still not safe to drink, and public health workers are trying to monitor thousands of Flint children who may have been exposed to high levels of lead, which can profoundly affect growth, behavior and intelligence over time.\nMr. Schuette said the employees charged Friday \u2014 three from Michigan\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services and three from its Department of Environmental Quality \u2014 all  attempted to bury or cover up, to downplay or hide information  about the lead contamination that began in April 2014, when Flint began using the Flint River as its water supply to save money.\n Their story was, there is nothing wrong with Flint water and it was perfectly safe to use,  said Mr. Schuette, a Republican who is seen as a possible candidate for governor in 2018.  In essence, these individuals concealed the truth. They were criminally wrong to do so. \nThe accused include Liane Shekter Smith, who led the state environmental agency\u2019s Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance unit until she was fired in February. Prosecutors said she withheld information about the severe health risks of using the water after the lead contamination was underway and failed to protect the citizens of Flint. She was charged with one count of misconduct in office, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, and one count of willful neglect of duty, a misdemeanor.\nThe other Department of Environmental Quality employees charged were Adam Rosenthal, a water regulator who prosecutors said doctored reports about lead levels in Flint\u2019s water, and Patrick Cook, another regulator they said misled officials with the federal Environmental Protection Agency about the city\u2019s water quality.\nBoth men were charged with misconduct in office and conspiracy. Mr. Cook was also charged with willful neglect of duty, and Mr. Rosenthal with tampering with evidence.\nAlso charged were Nancy Peeler, the Early Childhood Health Section manager in the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services; Robert Scott, a data analyst for the department; and Corinne Miller, a state epidemiologist.\nProsecutors said the three employees learned last July of a spike in the number of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels but concealed the results. After seeing an internal report showing the increase, Mr. Schuette said, Ms. Peeler and Mr. Scott  produced a bogus report  that showed no worrisome rise in lead levels.","doc-id":"77a50dff-ba25-4041-a05c-cf107fdaec99","isi-events":[{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":2506,"string":"withheld information","hstring":"withheld","start":2498,"hstart":2498,"end":2518},"patients":[],"sentenceID":25,"eventType":"Communicate-Event","agents":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":2488,"string":"Prosecutors","hstring":"Prosecutors","start":2477,"hstart":2477,"end":2488},{"synclass":"name","hend":2356,"string":"Liane Shekter Smith","hstring":"Liane Shekter Smith","start":2337,"hstart":2337,"end":2356}]},{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":1306,"string":"complaints","hstring":"complaints","start":1296,"hstart":1296,"end":1306},"patients":[],"sentenceID":15,"eventType":"Communicate-Event","agents":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":1294,"string":"residents","hstring":"residents","start":1285,"hstart":1285,"end":1294},{"synclass":"name","hend":1362,"string":"Gov.

Flint residents have been outraged that high-ranking officials have so far escaped any consequences.\nBut the Michigan attorney general, Bill Schuette, hinted at a news conference on Friday that charges against higher-level officials might follow, saying that investigators were \u201Cmoving up the chain\u201D and \u201Cgoing where the truth takes us, period.\u201D\nThe widening inquiry comes as Flint\u2019s residents continue to cope with the effects of the contamination. Concerns about the water emerged more than two years ago, but residents\u2019 complaints were brushed off until last fall, when Gov. Rick Snyder acknowledged the scope of the problem.\nTests continue to show that unfiltered tap water is still not safe to drink, and public health workers are trying to monitor thousands of Flint children who may have been exposed to high levels of lead, which can profoundly affect growth, behavior and intelligence over time.\nMr. Schuette said the employees charged Friday \u2014 three from Michigan\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services and three from its Department of Environmental Quality \u2014 all \u201Cattempted to bury or cover up, to downplay or hide information\u201D about the lead contamination that began in April 2014, when Flint began using the Flint River as its water supply to save money.\n\u201CTheir story was, there is nothing wrong with Flint water and it was perfectly safe to use,\u201D said Mr. Schuette, a Republican who is seen as a possible candidate for governor in 2018. \u201CIn essence, these individuals concealed the truth. They were criminally wrong to do so.\u201D\nThe accused include Liane Shekter Smith, who led the state environmental agency\u2019s Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance unit until she was fired in February. Prosecutors said she withheld information about the severe health risks of using the water after the lead contamination was underway and failed to protect the citizens of Flint. She was charged with one count of misconduct in office, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, and one count of willful neglect of duty, a misdemeanor.\nThe other Department of Environmental Quality employees charged were Adam Rosenthal, a water regulator who prosecutors said doctored reports about lead levels in Flint\u2019s water, and Patrick Cook, another regulator they said misled officials with the federal Environmental Protection Agency about the city\u2019s water quality.\nBoth men were charged with misconduct in office and conspiracy. Mr. Cook was also charged with willful neglect of duty, and Mr. Rosenthal with tampering with evidence.\nAlso charged were Nancy Peeler, the Early Childhood Health Section manager in the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services; Robert Scott, a data analyst for the department; and Corinne Miller, a state epidemiologist.\nProsecutors said the three employees learned last July of a spike in the number of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels but concealed the results. After seeing an internal report showing the increase, Mr. Schuette said, Ms. Peeler and Mr. Scott \u201Cproduced a bogus report\u201D that showed no worrisome rise in lead levels.","doc-id":"77a50dff-ba25-4041-a05c-cf107fdaec99","isi-events":[{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":2506,"string":"withheld information","hstring":"withheld","start":2498,"hstart":2498,"end":2518},"patients":[],"sentenceID":25,"eventType":"Communicate-Event","agents":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":2488,"string":"Prosecutors","hstring":"Prosecutors","start":2477,"hstart":2477,"end":2488},{"synclass":"name","hend":2356,"string":"Liane Shekter Smith","hstring":"Liane Shekter Smith","start":2337,"hstart":2337,"end":2356}]},{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":1306,"string":"complaints","hstring":"complaints","start":1296,"hstart":1296,"end":1306},"patients":[],"sentenceID":15,"eventType":"Communicate-Event","agents":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":1294,"string":"residents","hstring":"residents","start":1285,"hstart":1285,"end":1294},{"synclass":"name","hend":1362,"string":"Gov.

Susan Hedman, the EPA regional director, resigned in February over her handling of the crisis.\nMcCarthy said, \"I will take responsibility for not pushing hard enough, but I will not take responsibility for causing this problem. It was not EPA at the helm when this happened.\"\nMore than a dozen lawsuits, including several class-action ones, have been filed in state, county and federal courts in Michigan, according to legal experts. The remedies sought range from monetary compensation for lead poisoning to refunds for water bills.\nMost cases focus on the youngest victims of the man-made environmental calamity: the scores of children whose lead exposure could lead to maladies ranging from neurological disorders, such as seizures, to language and learning disabilities.","doc-id":"0775e00a-f4f0-42e1-a95b-39711518d415","isi-events":[{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":1811,"string":"complaint","hstring":"complaint","start":1802,"hstart":1802,"end":1811},"patients":[],"sentenceID":19,"eventType":"Judicial-Indict","agents":[]},{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":1816,"string":"said","hstring":"said","start":1812,"hstart":1812,"end":1816},"patients":[],"sentenceID":19,"eventType":"Communicate-Event","agents":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":1811,"string":"the

Flint residents have been outraged that high-ranking officials have so far escaped any consequences.\nBut the Michigan attorney general, Bill Schuette, hinted at a news conference on Friday that charges against higher-level officials might follow, saying that investigators were \u201Cmoving up the chain\u201D and \u201Cgoing where the truth takes us, period.\u201D\nThe widening inquiry comes as Flint\u2019s residents continue to cope with the effects of the contamination. Concerns about the water emerged more than two years ago, but residents\u2019 complaints were brushed off until last fall, when Gov. Rick Snyder acknowledged the scope of the problem.\nTests continue to show that unfiltered tap water is still not safe to drink, and public health workers are trying to monitor thousands of Flint children who may have been exposed to high levels of lead, which can profoundly affect growth, behavior and intelligence over time.\nMr. Schuette said the employees charged Friday \u2014 three from Michigan\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services and three from its Department of Environmental Quality \u2014 all \u201Cattempted to bury or cover up, to downplay or hide information\u201D about the lead contamination that began in April 2014, when Flint began using the Flint River as its water supply to save money.\n\u201CTheir story was, there is nothing wrong with Flint water and it was perfectly safe to use,\u201D said Mr. Schuette, a Republican who is seen as a possible candidate for governor in 2018. \u201CIn essence, these individuals concealed the truth. They were criminally wrong to do so.\u201D\nThe accused include Liane Shekter Smith, who led the state environmental agency\u2019s Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance unit until she was fired in February. Prosecutors said she withheld information about the severe health risks of using the water after the lead contamination was underway and failed to protect the citizens of Flint. She was charged with one count of misconduct in office, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, and one count of willful neglect of duty, a misdemeanor.\nThe other Department of Environmental Quality employees charged were Adam Rosenthal, a water regulator who prosecutors said doctored reports about lead levels in Flint\u2019s water, and Patrick Cook, another regulator they said misled officials with the federal Environmental Protection Agency about the city\u2019s water quality.\nBoth men were charged with misconduct in office and conspiracy. Mr. Cook was also charged with willful neglect of duty, and Mr. Rosenthal with tampering with evidence.\nAlso charged were Nancy Peeler, the Early Childhood Health Section manager in the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services; Robert Scott, a data analyst for the department; and Corinne Miller, a state epidemiologist.\nProsecutors said the three employees learned last July of a spike in the number of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels but concealed the results. After seeing an internal report showing the increase, Mr. Schuette said, Ms. Peeler and Mr. Scott \u201Cproduced a bogus report\u201D that showed no worrisome rise in lead levels.","doc-id":"77a50dff-ba25-4041-a05c-cf107fdaec99","isi-events":[{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":2506,"string":"withheld information","hstring":"withheld","start":2498,"hstart":2498,"end":2518},"patients":[],"sentenceID":25,"eventType":"Communicate-Event","agents":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":2488,"string":"Prosecutors","hstring":"Prosecutors","start":2477,"hstart":2477,"end":2488},{"synclass":"name","hend":2356,"string":"Liane Shekter Smith","hstring":"Liane Shekter Smith","start":2337,"hstart":2337,"end":2356}]},{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":1306,"string":"complaints","hstring":"complaints","start":1296,"hstart":1296,"end":1306},"patients":[],"sentenceID":15,"eventType":"Communicate-Event","agents":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":1294,"string":"residents","hstring":"residents","start":1285,"hstart":1285,"end":1294},{"synclass":"name","hend":1362,"string":"Gov.

Flint residents have been outraged that high-ranking officials have so far escaped any consequences.\nBut the Michigan attorney general, Bill Schuette, hinted at a news conference on Friday that charges against higher-level officials might follow, saying that investigators were \u201Cmoving up the chain\u201D and \u201Cgoing where the truth takes us, period.\u201D\nThe widening inquiry comes as Flint\u2019s residents continue to cope with the effects of the contamination. Concerns about the water emerged more than two years ago, but residents\u2019 complaints were brushed off until last fall, when Gov. Rick Snyder acknowledged the scope of the problem.\nTests continue to show that unfiltered tap water is still not safe to drink, and public health workers are trying to monitor thousands of Flint children who may have been exposed to high levels of lead, which can profoundly affect growth, behavior and intelligence over time.\nMr. Schuette said the employees charged Friday \u2014 three from Michigan\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services and three from its Department of Environmental Quality \u2014 all \u201Cattempted to bury or cover up, to downplay or hide information\u201D about the lead contamination that began in April 2014, when Flint began using the Flint River as its water supply to save money.\n\u201CTheir story was, there is nothing wrong with Flint water and it was perfectly safe to use,\u201D said Mr. Schuette, a Republican who is seen as a possible candidate for governor in 2018. \u201CIn essence, these individuals concealed the truth. They were criminally wrong to do so.\u201D\nThe accused include Liane Shekter Smith, who led the state environmental agency\u2019s Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance unit until she was fired in February. Prosecutors said she withheld information about the severe health risks of using the water after the lead contamination was underway and failed to protect the citizens of Flint. She was charged with one count of misconduct in office, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, and one count of willful neglect of duty, a misdemeanor.\nThe other Department of Environmental Quality employees charged were Adam Rosenthal, a water regulator who prosecutors said doctored reports about lead levels in Flint\u2019s water, and Patrick Cook, another regulator they said misled officials with the federal Environmental Protection Agency about the city\u2019s water quality.\nBoth men were charged with misconduct in office and conspiracy. Mr. Cook was also charged with willful neglect of duty, and Mr. Rosenthal with tampering with evidence.\nAlso charged were Nancy Peeler, the Early Childhood Health Section manager in the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services; Robert Scott, a data analyst for the department; and Corinne Miller, a state epidemiologist.\nProsecutors said the three employees learned last July of a spike in the number of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels but concealed the results. After seeing an internal report showing the increase, Mr. Schuette said, Ms. Peeler and Mr. Scott \u201Cproduced a bogus report\u201D that showed no worrisome rise in lead levels.","doc-id":"77a50dff-ba25-4041-a05c-cf107fdaec99","isi-events":[{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":2506,"string":"withheld information","hstring":"withheld","start":2498,"hstart":2498,"end":2518},"patients":[],"sentenceID":25,"eventType":"Communicate-Event","agents":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":2488,"string":"Prosecutors","hstring":"Prosecutors","start":2477,"hstart":2477,"end":2488},{"synclass":"name","hend":2356,"string":"Liane Shekter Smith","hstring":"Liane Shekter Smith","start":2337,"hstart":2337,"end":2356}]},{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":1306,"string":"complaints","hstring":"complaints","start":1296,"hstart":1296,"end":1306},"patients":[],"sentenceID":15,"eventType":"Communicate-Event","agents":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":1294,"string":"residents","hstring":"residents","start":1285,"hstart":1285,"end":1294},{"synclass":"name","hend":1362,"string":"Gov.

Her firing followed the resignations in December of the department\u2019s director, Dan Wyant, and chief spokesman, Brad Wurfel, both of whom were criticized for failing to recognize the scope of Flint\u2019s water problems and for belittling those who attempted to raise alarms. A fourth employee, who worked under Ms. Shekter Smith, has been suspended.\n\u201CPutting the well-being of Michiganders first needs to be the top priority for all state employees,\u201D Gov. Rick Snyder said in a statement about the firing. \u201CAnything less than that is unacceptable. The D.E.Q. is working to change this culture and ensure mistakes that endanger our residents don\u2019t occur again.\u201D\nThough a number of government agencies have been faulted for their response in Flint, the Environmental Quality Department has been held up by critics as particularly egregious. That agency failed to require corrosion controls mandated under federal law when Flint changed its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in April 2014. The lack of anti-corrosion chemicals caused pipes to disintegrate and leach lead into the water. Lead, which is especially harmful to children, is toxic and can have irreversible health effects. After initially dismissing outsiders who warned of the lead risk, Environmental Quality officials admitted in October that they had erred in not requiring corrosion controls.\nIn recent weeks, Michigan\u2019s attorney general, the F.B.I. and other federal agencies have announced investigations. Mr. Snyder, who has apologized to Flint residents, has been under fire. Hillary Clinton has announced plans to visit Flint on Sunday, and she and Bernie Sanders will hold a debate there next month.\nOn Friday, Mr. Sanders, responding to the release of emails that showed state and local officials had also delayed warning residents about an outbreak of Legionnaire\u2019s disease that they suspected could be related to the water supply, again called for the resignation of Mr. Snyder, a Republican.\nA Republican-led Congressional committee has also targeted the United States Environmental Protection Agency for scrutiny. At a hearing on Wednesday, committee members pressed the agency for an explanation of why top officials waited months to publicize their own scientist\u2019s concerns about lead in Flint. Susan Hedman, a presidential appointee who oversaw the E.P.A. regional office in charge of Michigan, announced her resignation last month.\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Michigan Water Regulator Fired for Role in Flint Crisis as Fallout Continues.

and baffled  by the public prosecutor's actions.\nSTORY HIGHLIGHTS\nEttore Gotti Tedeschi says he was also humiliated by the investigation\nHe said the bank must now explain the facts\nIt must also get on the  white list  of banks, he says\nRELATED TOPICS\nItaly\nRome, Italy (CNN) -- The president of the Vatican Bank told CNN on Friday he was incredulous and  humiliated  when he learned Italian investigators were looking into money-laundering allegations against the bank.\nItalian authorities informed the Vatican Bank about the probe on Tuesday, prosecutor Nello Rossi told CNN. Prosecutors seized 23 million euros (about $30 million) in Vatican Bank transactions  as a cautionary measure  on Monday, he said.\n My first reaction was of incredulity and afterwards, that of feeling humiliated in the intense work that, along with (bank) Director-General (Paolo) Cipriani and all of the institute's managers, I've been carrying out,  President Ettore Gotti Tedeschi told CNN by e-mail Friday.\n After discussing with Doctor Cipriani the actions that spurred the inquiry, I was relieved, and I've realized that we had to immediately take action in explaining the facts to various levels and places,  he said.\nTedeschi said he also realized the need to speed up the process of getting the Vatican Bank on the  white list  of banks that comply with internationally agreed standards,  to prevent other misunderstanding events like the one that just happened. \nThis is not the first time Italian prosecutors have investigated the bank, but probes are extremely rare, Rossi said.\nThe probe began after another Italian bank informed Bank of Italy investigators of two Vatican Bank transactions that did not appear to comply with anti-money laundering requirements, the Bank of Italy said Tuesday.\nWhen Bank of Italy investigators told legal authorities about the transactions, they were told that judicial authorities were already investigating the Vatican Bank, a source close to the investigation said.\nThe Vatican said Tuesday that it was  perplexed and baffled  by the public prosecutor's actions and that the Holy See aims for  complete transparency  in its financial operations.\nThe Vatican Bank is  the most secret bank in the world,  author Jeffrey Robinson said Tuesday, and he said there is no way to find out how much money it controls.\nThe Vatican's sources of income include its vast real estate holdings, explained Robinson, who wrote  The Laundrymen,  which looks at money laundering worldwide.\n They are huge, huge landholders,  he said.\nThe Bank of Italy investigation was prompted by two wire transfers that the Vatican Bank asked Credito Artigiano to carry out, the Bank of Italy said.\nThe Vatican Bank did not provide enough information about the transfers -- one for 20 million euros (about $26 million) and one for 3 million euros (about $4 million) -- to comply with the law, prompting the Bank of Italy to suspend them automatically, it said.\nIt is not entirely clear how much legal authority Italian officials have over the Vatican Bank, since the Vatican is a sovereign state.\nThey had the power to seize the money and stop the transactions because they took place on Italian soil, said Rossi, the prosecutor.\nAn effort by Holocaust survivors to sue the Vatican Bank in the United States failed in 2009 when a U.S. court ruled that the Vatican Bank had  sovereign immunity  and was not subject to lawsuits filed in the United States.\nA lawsuit against related entities is still in court.\nThe Vatican Bank was created by an order of the pope  to carry on activities that are for pious causes,  according to expert testimony related to the Holocaust suit.\nIt accepts deposits only from top Catholic Church officials and entities, Settimio Caridi testified in U.S. District Court in 2006.\nIt uses its funds  for designated pious purposes  and is  an autonomous pious foundation,  he said.\nCaridi, a top Italian legal scholar who was called to testify by Vatican lawyers, said the bank is an integral part of the Vatican, a  central entity under the oversight of the Holy See. \nIt is ultimately overseen by a commission of five cardinals -- the top position in the Vatican hierarchy below the pope -- which is headed by the Vatican secretary of state.\nThe Vatican Bank is subject to particularly stringent anti-money laundering regulations because Italian law does not consider it to be operating within the European Union.\nIt must supply more detailed information about transactions than European Union banks have to give.\nCNN's Hada Messia in Rome, Italy, and Richard Allen Greene in London, England, contributed to this report.\nShare this

April 27, 2018. (Korea Summit Press Pool\/AP)\nHong Seok-Hyun is the owner of JoongAng Holdings, South Korea\u2019s largest media group. He served as President Moon Jae-in\u2019s special envoy to the U.S. in 2017 and was the South Korean ambassador to the U.S. in 2005.\nSEOUL \u2014 The winds of change are sweeping Northeast Asia. The upcoming historic meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump is sure to mark a turning point in the destiny of the Korean Peninsula. Although there are concerns over all the uncertainties, I harbor cautious optimism for the road ahead because I discern a sincerity in Kim. To test that sincerity, we need to give Kim the benefit of the doubt.\nIn the recent, historic Panmunjom summit, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in pledged to end the war on the Korean Peninsula. Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, carried the full text of the Panmunjom Declaration, which clearly states North Korea is intent on  complete denuclearization. \nKim\u2019s change of heart likely resulted from his realization that as long as he holds on to nuclear weapons, economic development will be difficult. Just last month, Kim shifted policy from simultaneously pursuing nuclear weapons and economic development to focusing solely on advancing the economy. North Koreans are experimenting with the market economy: There are hundreds of informal markets known as   jangmadang ,  and there are millions of mobile phones in circulation. Kim may have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to suppress the desires and grievances of his people if the current  maximum pressure  campaign against North Korea continues. Kim\u2019s aspiration for Chinese and Vietnamese-style economic growth could have been another factor.\nTrump and Moon deserve the credit for bringing about Kim\u2019s change in attitude. Asserting his stance to achieve  peace through strength,  Trump exerted maximum pressure on North Korea both economically and militarily. Trump\u2019s decisive move was convincing China to join tougher international economic sanctions against North Korea. Moon, for his part, brought North Korea to the dialogue table with steadfast diplomatic mediation.\nKim\u2019s shrewd judgment and boldness in finding the right time to place his bet after reading his opponent\u2019s hand is remarkable. His level of confidence and dignity also stood out. Throughout the Panmunjom summit, Kim succeeded somewhat in dispelling his image as an unstable and untrustworthy young dictator. He was polite and courteous to Moon, who is old enough to be his father. The connection forged between the two leaders will be a priceless asset in resolving future inter-Korean issues.\nTrump has said he will not repeat the mistakes of previous administrations and is staunchly demanding  complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization  of North Korea. Contrary to this, Kim is likely calling for a complete, verifiable, irreversible guarantee for his regime. We need to settle the issue of denuclearization and regime guarantee once and for all by exchanging the former for the latter. We also need to set the earliest possible deadline for denuclearization: no later than the fall of 2020, when Trump is expected to run for a second term. To do this, the South Korean and U.S. leaders need to agree on a denuclearization roadmap when they meet on May 22 ahead of the U.S.-North Korea summit.\nIn the Panmunjom Declaration, Moon and Kim confirmed their common goal of realizing a  nuclear-free Korean Peninsula,  but there could be a catch in that phrase. The phrase could include the withdrawal of U.S. Forces Korea and their ability to mobilize nuclear weapons here, or perhaps a ban on dispatching strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula, or the dismantlement of the nuclear umbrella for South Korea. Overall, it looks as if the key agenda of denuclearization was overshadowed by the push to promote inter-Korean relations. With the promise of the end of inter-Korean war, Kim has, in effect, neutralized the U.S. military option.\nDenuclearization is an issue for the United States and North Korea to resolve, but in a bigger sense, it\u2019s an issue between the United States and China. It would have been difficult to set a U.S.-North Korea summit had it not been for China\u2019s cooperation. China must not feel left out in the process of establishing a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. If Trump assumes a strategic stance on this issue, he will consider using North Korea as a card in recalibrating U.S.-China relations.\nWe must also not forget Japan. Japan is an indispensable factor in incorporating North Korea into the global economy and the multilateral security order in Northeast Asia. South Korea, the United States and Japan have to play as a team in order to realize complete denuclearization and establish a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\nKim must demonstrate his goodwill ahead of his meeting with Trump. It will help pave the way for successful talks if Kim returns the three American detainees held in North Korea and takes proactive measures regarding his country\u2019s human rights violations. Trump should also prepare enticing gifts for Kim; the best gifts would be institutional measures to buttress economic development. Those initiatives could include the provision of large-scale development assistance and preferential tariff systems to follow immediately after denuclearization is achieved.\nIf Kim gives up his country\u2019s nuclear program, which is specified in the constitution, it will be a challenge to deal with underlying dissatisfaction among his military brass. North Korea also has to overcome South Koreans\u2019 sense of distrust. It\u2019s not just anti-Communist and conservative factions \u2014 even the younger generation in South Korea harbors a cynicism and distrust of North Korea and Kim. Moon needs to embrace the naysayers in order to build national consensus. These barriers will be hard to clear if they are not supported by swift denuclearization.\nAs Confucius said,  Without trust, we cannot stand.  Even if there is a lack of trust now, we can solve our problems if we start by giving Kim the benefit of the doubt. This is our last chance. In the upcoming summit with Trump, Kim should show us the bold and open attitude he had at the Panmunjom summit. I hope the ripples of peace that started in Panmunjom will turn into great waves through the Trump-Kim talks to dismantle the Cold War framework on the Korean Peninsula and throughout Northeast Asia.\nThis was produced by The WorldPost , a partnership of the Berggruen Institute and The Washington Post.\nThe story must be told.\nYour subscription supports journalism that

The upcoming historic meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump is sure to mark a turning point in the destiny of the Korean Peninsula. Although there are concerns over all the uncertainties, I harbor cautious optimism for the road ahead because I discern a sincerity in Kim. To test that sincerity, we need to give Kim the benefit of the doubt.\nIn the recent, historic Panmunjom summit, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in pledged to end the war on the Korean Peninsula. Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, carried the full text of the Panmunjom Declaration, which clearly states North Korea is intent on \u201Ccomplete denuclearization.\u201D\nKim\u2019s change of heart likely resulted from his realization that as long as he holds on to nuclear weapons, economic development will be difficult. Just last month, Kim shifted policy from simultaneously pursuing nuclear weapons and economic development to focusing solely on advancing the economy. North Koreans are experimenting with the market economy: There are hundreds of informal markets known as \u201C jangmadang ,\u201D and there are millions of mobile phones in circulation. Kim may have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to suppress the desires and grievances of his people if the current \u201Cmaximum pressure\u201D campaign against North Korea continues. Kim\u2019s aspiration for Chinese and Vietnamese-style economic growth could have been another factor.\nTrump and Moon deserve the credit for bringing about Kim\u2019s change in attitude. Asserting his stance to achieve \u201Cpeace through strength,\u201D Trump exerted maximum pressure on North Korea both economically and militarily. Trump\u2019s decisive move was convincing China to join tougher international economic sanctions against North Korea. Moon, for his part, brought North Korea to the dialogue table with steadfast diplomatic mediation.\nKim\u2019s shrewd judgment and boldness in finding the right time to place his bet after reading his opponent\u2019s hand is remarkable. His level of confidence and dignity also stood out. Throughout the Panmunjom summit, Kim succeeded somewhat in dispelling his image as an unstable and untrustworthy young dictator. He was polite and courteous to Moon, who is old enough to be his father. The connection forged between the two leaders will be a priceless asset in resolving future inter-Korean issues.\nTrump has said he will not repeat the mistakes of previous administrations and is staunchly demanding \u201Ccomplete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization\u201D of North Korea. Contrary to this, Kim is likely calling for a complete, verifiable, irreversible guarantee for his regime. We need to settle the issue of denuclearization and regime guarantee once and for all by exchanging the former for the latter. We also need to set the earliest possible deadline for denuclearization: no later than the fall of 2020, when Trump is expected to run for a second term. To do this, the South Korean and U.S. leaders need to agree on a denuclearization roadmap when they meet on May 22 ahead of the U.S.-North Korea summit.\nIn the Panmunjom Declaration, Moon and Kim confirmed their common goal of realizing a \u201Cnuclear-free Korean Peninsula,\u201D but there could be a catch in that phrase. The phrase could include the withdrawal of U.S. Forces Korea and their ability to mobilize nuclear weapons here, or perhaps a ban on dispatching strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula, or the dismantlement of the nuclear umbrella for South Korea. Overall, it looks as if the key agenda of denuclearization was overshadowed by the push to promote inter-Korean relations. With the promise of the end of inter-Korean war, Kim has, in effect, neutralized the U.S. military option.\nDenuclearization is an issue for the United States and North Korea to resolve, but in a bigger sense, it\u2019s an issue between the United States and China. It would have been difficult to set a U.S.-North Korea summit had it not been for China\u2019s cooperation. China must not feel left out in the process of establishing a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. If Trump assumes a strategic stance on this issue, he will consider using North Korea as a card in recalibrating U.S.-China relations.\nWe must also not forget Japan. Japan is an indispensable factor in incorporating North Korea into the global economy and the multilateral security order in Northeast Asia. South Korea, the United States and Japan have to play as a team in order to realize complete denuclearization and establish a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\nKim must demonstrate his goodwill ahead of his meeting with Trump. It will help pave the way for successful talks if Kim returns the three American detainees held in North Korea and takes proactive measures regarding his country\u2019s human rights violations. Trump should also prepare enticing gifts for Kim; the best gifts would be institutional measures to buttress economic development. Those initiatives could include the provision of large-scale development assistance and preferential tariff systems to follow immediately after denuclearization is achieved.\nIf Kim gives up his country\u2019s nuclear program, which is specified in the constitution, it will be a challenge to deal with underlying dissatisfaction among his military brass. North Korea also has to overcome South Koreans\u2019 sense of distrust. It\u2019s not just anti-Communist and conservative factions \u2014 even the younger generation in South Korea harbors a cynicism and distrust of North Korea and Kim. Moon needs to embrace the naysayers in order to build national consensus. These barriers will be hard to clear if they are not supported by swift denuclearization.\nAs Confucius said, \u201CWithout trust, we cannot stand.\u201D Even if there is a lack of trust now, we can solve our problems if we start by giving Kim the benefit of the doubt. This is our last chance. In the upcoming summit with Trump, Kim should show us the bold and open attitude he had at the Panmunjom summit. I hope the ripples of peace that started in Panmunjom will turn into great waves through the Trump-Kim talks to dismantle the Cold War framework on the Korean Peninsula and throughout Northeast Asia.\nThis was produced by The WorldPost , a partnership of the Berggruen Institute and The Washington Post.\nThe story must be told.\nYour subscription supports journalism that

non-committal response to North Korean threats to cancel his planned summit with Kim Jong Un, saying he hadn't received any information that would put the talks in jeopardy.\n\"We haven't been notified at all, we'll have to see,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, where he was meeting his Uzbek counterpart. \"We haven't seen anything, we haven't heard anything. We will see what happens.\"\nBut pressed whether he would still insist upon North Korea's denuclearization as a condition for the talks, Trump nodded yes.\nTrump's aides were working Wednesday to determine whether overnight warnings from North Korea might scuttle the highly anticipated summit, even as some in the administration conceded the threats were an expected bump in any dealing with the unpredictable hermit regime.\nTrump's Korea hopes thrown into turmoil\nThe tough statements from Pyongyang ended the diplomatic warming that had been leading up to the June 12 encounter between the two men, slated to occur in Singapore. The US administration had no advance warning that a top North Korean official would threaten to call off the talks if joint military exercises with South Korea continue or if the US maintained its insistence that North Korea immediately dismantle its nuclear program.\nRead More\n\"The President is all over this today,\" said White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley.\nAs the statements, written in the North's idiosyncratic rhetoric, emerged from the North Korea news service on Tuesday evening, American officials scrambled to get a handle on what precisely had been said, and whether it posed a real risk to the President's upcoming meeting.\nDuring an official visit to France on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said said the United  States should \"cherish the current opportunity for peace\" with North Korea, according to a statement by the Foreign Ministry.\n\"The nuclear issue on the peninsula has a long history and is complicated. To solve this problem, it is necessary to meet halfway rather than run in the opposite direction,\" Wang said, according to the statement, adding the current lessening in tensions was \"hard-won.\"\nTrump was preparing to depart the White House for the Walter Reed medical center, where is wife Melania is convalescing after a kidney procedure, when the initial statement warning against joint military exercises emerged on Tuesday afternoon.

bureaucracy in the hopes that the sun could one day power half the town. Here, solar panels on a television studio in Brooklyn.\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- About two-thirds of the one million rooftops in New York City are suitable for solar power.\nIf every one of those roofs had solar panels, when the sun shines the brightest the city could get half its electricity from solar power.\nPrint\nNew York has a long way to go before becoming that solar utopia. The city currently gets only a tiny fraction of its power from solar. And until there's a good way to store the electricity generated during the day and release it at night, solar will likely continue to make up a modest part of the city's overall energy mix.\nBut even a small amount of solar can help the city in big ways. It can reduce the overall stress on the electric grid , eliminating the need to build expensive new transformers or lay underground transmission wire.\nDuring hot days when air conditioning is working overtime, it can reduce the chance of a blackout and cut the need to fire up older, dirtier generators.\n Some people are waiting to see what the federal or state government will do,  David Bragdon, head of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's sustainability office, said at a recent solar conference in the city.  But important things are happening right here. \nThe Groupon of solar power\nAmong them: A new hyper-accurate map of the city that is designed to gauge solar's potential building-by-building. A plan to put solar farms on top of old landfills. New financial incentives that add to existing city, state and federal subsidies. And an overall streamlining of the solar power permitting bureaucracy.\nThese measures, combined with a mandate that requires 30% of the state's power to come from renewable sources by 2015, are driving the development of solar.\nIn addition to reducing current demand on the grid, the idea behind solar subsidies and mandates is to foster a stable and growing market for the technology. That way, the private sector will put the time and money into solar research, and perhaps one day it can meet a big chunk of New York's power needs.\n0:00 \/ 2:52 NYC looks to solar to combat blackouts\nRight now solar is still a minuscule part of the city's overall power consumption -- six megawatts out of an electrical appetite that can reach 13,000 megawatts. But it has doubled over the last year, and is expected to grow another five-fold by 2015, according to Tria Case, director of sustainability at the City University of New York.\nCUNY, along with a handful of other organizations, has been spearheading the effort to bring more solar power to New York.\nIn 2007 Case received a grant from the federal Department of Energy that designated New York as one of 25  Solar American Cities,  big cities across the country that would serve as testing grounds for solar power.\nThe grant, about $200,000, was used to create a position of solar ombudsman -- someone who would coordinate between all the various government agencies, non-profits, private companies and the local utility, Consolidated Edison ( ED , Fortune 500 ), that are working on solar power.\nLast month CUNY rolled out something even more impressive, at least visually. Using aircraft-mounted laser beams, the university used DOE and city money to create a map out of 15 billion points of data that can pinpoint exactly how much solar can go on any rooftop in the city, how much it will cost, what the incentives are and how long it will take for the homeowner to recoup the investment.\nThere are other maps of this kind , but none with such detail. This solar map can pinpoint objects down to the size of a coffee cup, and factors in things like shadows from trees or other buildings, fire code setbacks or stairway entrances to give the most accurate reading of just how much solar energy a building can generate.\n New York now has the most granular view of the city it's ever had,  said Case.  Folks out there want to understand what's possible, and this is really a very powerful tool. \nFor people like Jesse Cutaia, the solar map might mean more business.\nCutaia is a project manager at Solar Energy Systems, at New York-Based firm that designs and builds solar installations .\n It's a very helpful tool for a building owner to assess their own roof,  he said.  It's a great resource to help promote solar in NYC. \nLast week Cutaia spoke to CNNMoney on the roof of a film studio in Brooklyn's Greenpoint section.\nThe studio, Broadway Stages, has combined various incentives from the federal government, the city and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to put a $2 million solar installation on three buildings it owns in the area.\nThe panels provide 35% of the power at the studios, which currently serve as sets for the TV shows The Good Wife, Royal Pains and Blue Bloods. After all subsidies are claimed, Cutaia said the system will pay for itself in electricity savings after just four years.\n With the money that's available these days, especially in New York City, the economics speak for themselves,  said Cutaia.\nThe money is substantial. Using the solar map to run the numbers for a residential rooftop in Brooklyn, the incentives on a $60,000 system added up to over $40,000.\nSoon there will be even more money available. As part of the solar effort, New York recently designated three sections of city  solar empowerment zones,  eligible for a tax credit to cover an additional 15% of the cost of a system. The areas were chosen based on where the electricity grid needed the additional power the most.\nWhat Cutaia would really like to see is a one-stop shop to permit solar projects. Currently, he says he has to work with four or five different agencies. This is a common complaint of solar developers nationwide.\nCon Edision is working on this.\nThe company recently spearheaded an effort to approve all solar projects within 100 days or less.\n0:00 \/ 2:35 Solar power scrubs NYC subways clean\nSome say Con Edison -- and utilities in general -- are not inclined to support a system like solar where the customers generate their own power.\nAnd while some in the industry fault ConEdison for fighting a bill requiring more solar power in New York State, others give the utility credit for getting serious with solar over the last few years.\nJohn Mucci, Con Edison's vice president of Manhattan operations, said the utility doesn't support the solar bill because it will raise rates for its customers and that the renewable mandate of 30% is enough at this time.\nMucci pointed out that the company is now responsible for just the wires and transformers and is no longer in the power generation business, and thus it does not view solar as a competitor.\nHe said solar does make the grid stronger, can prevent blackouts and keeps the utility from having to make expensive upgrades.\nHe also supports it from a green perspective.\n Anything that generates energy and doesn't burn anything is an amazing technology,  said Mucci.  We should try to use more of it. \nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that 80% of New York City rooftops are suitable for solar power. \nFirst Published: July 25, 2011:

US solar industry. Photograph: Robert Nickelsberg\/Getty Images\nThe solar company Solyndra recently filed for bankruptcy, which media reports have depicted as the end of solar power in the U.S. This is like saying there is no future for the internet because Netscape went out of business.\nThe molar-grinding irony of it all is that Solyndra was the victim of a big success -- the price of solar power has fallen rapidly, making more expensive technologies like theirs uncompetitive, but more importantly, making solar power a real player in the U.S. energy economy.\nSince October of 2008, the average price of solar modules has fallen from $4.20 per watt to around $1.20 to $1.50 per watt today. These are mind-boggling reductions. And these new prices are resulting in extraordinary market development. As of June, California utilities have signed over eight gigawatts of solar contracts ... half of which are below the price of new natural gas generation. That's right. Gigawatts of solar cheaper than the fossil fuel alternatives.\nThe media have been hinting at scandal and impropriety. While we have no idea about Solyndra's actions in securing the loan guarantee, we can say that their technology approach was squarely within mainstream thinking of the time. Solyndra was attempting to develop a photovoltaic (PV) technology that didn't use silicon, the dominant raw material for PV then and today. Take a look at this chart [PDF] . For years, silicon was manufactured primarily for semiconductors, and the solar industry essentially relied on excess material. In 2004, when Germany introduced robust incentives and the solar industry really started taking off, a shortage of silicon became a huge problem. There were seven plants in the world capable of manufacturing solar grade silicon, and as they had the scarcity in the value chain, they were able to command premium prices. The market price of silicon went through the roof. The main material for crystalline PV technology, which once cost $25 per kilogram (kg), soared to $450 per kg. Silicon manufacturers had the solar industry by the short hairs, and everyone looked for an alternative. Silicon was the single biggest obstacle to bringing down costs and bringing solar to scale, and everybody -- absolutely everybody -- was trying to figure out how to deal with it.\nSolar manufacturers that had relied on silicon-based PV technology tried to develop new methods that didn't need silicon. For example, Sharp, which was once the world's largest PV manufacturer using crystalline silicon technology, made a significant capital investment in a thin-film product that was half as efficient ... but used about 1 percent of the silicon [PDF] . And venture-capital money poured into start-ups working on breakthrough new materials that addressed the silicon problem. Nanosolar, Miasole, HelioVolt, and, yes, Solyndra, all received hundreds of millions of dollars of private venture funds to commercialize CIGS technology -- an approach that did not rely on any silicon at all. Solyndra's premise was squarely within mainstream thinking.\nSo what happened? Silicon got cheap , and the manufacture of crystalline silicon panels got even cheaper. All the innovation, market pressures, and government investment worked. Analysis out on Friday from the DOE's Lawrence Berkeley National Lab shows that the pre-incentive price of going solar in the U.S. dropped 17 percent last year, and another 11 percent in the first half of 2011 -- record reductions since they began tracking the data. Importantly, the Berkeley Lab report further indicates that federal and state market-building policies have been instrumental to those gains. What little policy support solar has received relative to its fossil counterparts is working as it should -- to build scale, bring down costs, and deliver strong economic returns on our nation's investment. And today the solar power industry is the fastest-growing industry in America.\nThe holy grail of those working in the field is to bring down costs. Solyndra had a reputed cost structure around $2 per watt. The fact that's no longer competitive is a sign that solar is succeeding, and delivering on its promise faster and better than the brightest minds and the big bucks ever

City, Nev., Acciona Energy operates Nevada Solar One, a solar thermal installation with mirrors that gather heat from the sun and convert it into electricity. The plant produces 64 megawatts. Credit Tiffany Brown\nScientists have struggled for years to make electricity from the sun\u2019s light at a cost competitive with power from coal or natural gas. The challenges are formidable. But now they are close, using the sun\u2019s heat instead.\nLast month, Acciona Energy, a Spanish company, opened a solar thermal installation spread across 400 acres of desert outside Boulder City, Nev., 25 miles southwest of Las Vegas. Called Nevada Solar One, it has 47 miles of trough-shaped mirrors, lined up in rows. Producing 64 megawatts, it is many times larger than the largest photovoltaic installations, which use the cells that are found in everything from rooftop panels to pocket calculators.\nAcciona will not disclose the production costs at the thermal plant, which was subsidized by the Energy Department. But according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, representing manufacturers of both photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, power from solar thermal electricity costs 12 to 14 cents a kilowatt-hour to produce, while power from solar cells costs 18 to 40 cents a kilowatt-hour. The national average retail price of electricity  is about 10.5 cents a kilowatt-hour.\nPhotovoltaic cells, first made practical for the space program, are falling in price, but so are the thermal systems, which focus sunlight on a fluid-filled pipe to collect the heat.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\n There\u2019s really this renaissance of solar thermal technology, and people are working very hard on how to reduce costs,  said Martin Heming, the executive in charge of solar technology at Schott, the German company that made the collector pipe for Nevada Solar One.\nContinue reading the main story\nSchott is developing a system that will use molten salt, rather than a liquid, to fill the pipes.

The water is boiled and the steam drives a turbine, as in coal plants.\nBut a typical coal-burning plant produces about  600 megawatts, roughly 10 times more than Nevada Solar One does.

Photograph: Shuji Kajiyama\/AP\nThe billionaire investor Warren Buffett has agreed to buy a solar power farm in California worth $2bn (£1.3bn).\nBuffett's MidAmerican Energy Holdings will take over Topaz Solar Farm, which is expected to produce enough power to run 160,000 homes when it is up and running in 2015. The farm , halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, is the world's second-largest photovoltaic plant under construction and is expected to generate 550-megawatts of electricity or about half the power of a nuclear reactor.\nThe deal comes hot on the heels of a string of green energy investments by the famous investor. MidAmerican, which is part of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, is the largest wind energy provider in the US where it operates more than a dozen wind farms.\nMidAmerican sealed the deal for Topaz on Wednesday, a day after the seller, First Solar, failed to secure a US government loan guarantee for the project. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but First Solar's difficulties securing funding for the vast project suggests Buffett probably got a good deal. First Solar will continue to build the farm on behalf of Berkshire and it is due to open in early 2015.\nGreg Abel, chief executive officer of MidAmerican, said:  [Topaz] demonstrates that solar energy is a commercially viable technology without the support of governmental loan guarantees. \nAnalysts suggested Buffett is moving from wind to solar power to take advantage of lucrative tax breaks.

This is a common complaint of solar developers nationwide.\nCon Edision is working on this.\nThe company recently spearheaded an effort to approve all solar projects within 100 days or less.\n0:00 \/ 2:35 Solar power scrubs NYC subways clean\nSome say Con Edison -- and utilities in general -- are not inclined to support a system like solar where the customers generate their own power.\nAnd while some in the industry fault ConEdison for fighting a bill requiring more solar power in New York State, others give the utility credit for getting serious with solar over the last few years.\nJohn Mucci, Con Edison's vice president of Manhattan operations, said the utility doesn't support the solar bill because it will raise rates for its customers and that the renewable mandate of 30% is enough at this time.\nMucci pointed out that the company is now responsible for just the wires and transformers and is no longer in the power generation business, and thus it does not view solar as a competitor.\nHe said solar does make the grid stronger, can prevent blackouts and keeps the utility from having to make expensive upgrades.\nHe also supports it from a green perspective.\n\"Anything that generates energy and doesn't burn anything is an amazing technology,\" said Mucci. \"We should try to use more of it.\"\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that 80% of New York City rooftops are suitable for solar power. \nFirst Published: July 25, 2011: 5:59 AM ET\nRelated

City, Nev., Acciona Energy operates Nevada Solar One, a solar thermal installation with mirrors that gather heat from the sun and convert it into electricity. The plant produces 64 megawatts. Credit Tiffany Brown\nScientists have struggled for years to make electricity from the sun\u2019s light at a cost competitive with power from coal or natural gas. The challenges are formidable. But now they are close, using the sun\u2019s heat instead.\nLast month, Acciona Energy, a Spanish company, opened a solar thermal installation spread across 400 acres of desert outside Boulder City, Nev., 25 miles southwest of Las Vegas. Called Nevada Solar One, it has 47 miles of trough-shaped mirrors, lined up in rows. Producing 64 megawatts, it is many times larger than the largest photovoltaic installations, which use the cells that are found in everything from rooftop panels to pocket calculators.\nAcciona will not disclose the production costs at the thermal plant, which was subsidized by the Energy Department. But according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, representing manufacturers of both photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, power from solar thermal electricity costs 12 to 14 cents a kilowatt-hour to produce, while power from solar cells costs 18 to 40 cents a kilowatt-hour. The national average retail price of electricity  is about 10.5 cents a kilowatt-hour.\nPhotovoltaic cells, first made practical for the space program, are falling in price, but so are the thermal systems, which focus sunlight on a fluid-filled pipe to collect the heat.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\n\u201CThere\u2019s really this renaissance of solar thermal technology, and people are working very hard on how to reduce costs,\u201D said Martin Heming, the executive in charge of solar technology at Schott, the German company that made the collector pipe for Nevada Solar One.\nContinue reading the main story\nSchott is developing a system that will use molten salt, rather than a liquid, to fill the pipes. Salt could absorb the same amount of heat or more without boiling, and it would stay at atmospheric pressure. The current system heats the pipe to 750 degrees, helped by small electric motors that change the angle of the mirrors during the day to face the sun.\nThe heated fluid runs through the pipes to a central power block, where it flows through a network of pipes bathed in ordinary water. The water is boiled and the steam drives a turbine, as in coal plants.\nBut a typical coal-burning plant produces about  600 megawatts, roughly 10 times more than Nevada Solar One does. \u201CThe optimum economic size is probably even larger than Nevada Solar One,\u201D said Thomas R. Fair, executive for renewable energy at the two companies that are buying the solar plant\u2019s output, the Nevada Power Company and the Sierra Pacific Power Company. There is a lot of  open desert land, he said.\nA new generation of solar thermal plants is likely to use more efficient technology. Mr. Heming said that switching to sodium, for example, would allow for higher temperatures. Less energy would leak out of the pipe, and electric output would rise.\nSolar thermal power is also being applied in two other ways. One is a supplement to a combined-cycle gas plant. In those plants, natural gas is burned in a jet engine, turning a turbine shaft to make electricity. The exhaust is used to boil water, and that steam is used to turn a second turbine, making more electricity.\nNewsletter Sign Up\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Proponents say that such a system could get about one-sixth more work out of the natural gas by operating at 70 percent efficiency. Most current  plants operate with efficiencies in the range of 50 percent to 60 percent.\nThe World Bank is considering financial help for projects in Egypt and Morocco that would create such a hybrid plant.\nThe second application shows that not all solar thermal projects are large and high-tech.

US solar industry. Photograph: Robert Nickelsberg\/Getty Images\nThe solar company Solyndra recently filed for bankruptcy, which media reports have depicted as the end of solar power in the U.S. This is like saying there is no future for the internet because Netscape went out of business.\nThe molar-grinding irony of it all is that Solyndra was the victim of a big success -- the price of solar power has fallen rapidly, making more expensive technologies like theirs uncompetitive, but more importantly, making solar power a real player in the U.S. energy economy.\nSince October of 2008, the average price of solar modules has fallen from $4.20 per watt to around $1.20 to $1.50 per watt today. These are mind-boggling reductions. And these new prices are resulting in extraordinary market development. As of June, California utilities have signed over eight gigawatts of solar contracts ... half of which are below the price of new natural gas generation. That's right. Gigawatts of solar cheaper than the fossil fuel alternatives.\nThe media have been hinting at scandal and impropriety. While we have no idea about Solyndra's actions in securing the loan guarantee, we can say that their technology approach was squarely within mainstream thinking of the time. Solyndra was attempting to develop a photovoltaic (PV) technology that didn't use silicon, the dominant raw material for PV then and today. Take a look at this chart [PDF] . For years, silicon was manufactured primarily for semiconductors, and the solar industry essentially relied on excess material. In 2004, when Germany introduced robust incentives and the solar industry really started taking off, a shortage of silicon became a huge problem. There were seven plants in the world capable of manufacturing solar grade silicon, and as they had the scarcity in the value chain, they were able to command premium prices. The market price of silicon went through the roof. The main material for crystalline PV technology, which once cost $25 per kilogram (kg), soared to $450 per kg. Silicon manufacturers had the solar industry by the short hairs, and everyone looked for an alternative. Silicon was the single biggest obstacle to bringing down costs and bringing solar to scale, and everybody -- absolutely everybody -- was trying to figure out how to deal with it.\nSolar manufacturers that had relied on silicon-based PV technology tried to develop new methods that didn't need silicon. For example, Sharp, which was once the world's largest PV manufacturer using crystalline silicon technology, made a significant capital investment in a thin-film product that was half as efficient ... but used about 1 percent of the silicon [PDF] . And venture-capital money poured into start-ups working on breakthrough new materials that addressed the silicon problem. Nanosolar, Miasole, HelioVolt, and, yes, Solyndra, all received hundreds of millions of dollars of private venture funds to commercialize CIGS technology -- an approach that did not rely on any silicon at all. Solyndra's premise was squarely within mainstream thinking.\nSo what happened? Silicon got cheap , and the manufacture of crystalline silicon panels got even cheaper. All the innovation, market pressures, and government investment worked. Analysis out on Friday from the DOE's Lawrence Berkeley National Lab shows that the pre-incentive price of going solar in the U.S. dropped 17 percent last year, and another 11 percent in the first half of 2011 -- record reductions since they began tracking the data. Importantly, the Berkeley Lab report further indicates that federal and state market-building policies have been instrumental to those gains. What little policy support solar has received relative to its fossil counterparts is working as it should -- to build scale, bring down costs, and deliver strong economic returns on our nation's investment. And today the solar power industry is the fastest-growing industry in America.\nThe holy grail of those working in the field is to bring down costs. Solyndra had a reputed cost structure around $2 per watt. The fact that's no longer competitive is a sign that solar is succeeding, and delivering on its promise faster and better than the brightest minds and the big bucks ever imagined.\nTopics","doc-id":"29098d3c-00f9-4860-97e2-f04e9471efcf","isi-events":[{"anchor":{"synclass":"event-anchor","hend":455,"string":"death","hstring":"death","start":450,"hstart":450,"end":455},"patients":[{"synclass":"nominal","hend":480,"string":"the
